# HW-----Array-Parsing

First the console prompts the user to enter the size of the array for how many entries they will be inputting.

Then the program sets up a loop to take the entries of the user.

If they entered an invalid number then the console will ignore the entry and ask the user to give a valid one.

Then finally the program will loop one more time and display each of the data entries.
